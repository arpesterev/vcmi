# Native source-policy ports

## FHeroes2Tactics

`FHeroes2Tactics` is a partial, experimental combat policy constructed by the
normal VCMI `AIFactory` and called through `BattleEventAdapter`. It is not the
complete fheroes2 AI and is not registered as the acceptance ID `FHeroes2`.
It never delegates decisions to BattleAI, StupidAI or MMAI.

The stance predicate and melee-outcome comparator come from fheroes2
`0dbfe9f386f33c2500842f4a59cd284d7f03d541`, `src/fheroes2/ai/ai_battle.cpp`.
VCMI supplies legal positions, pathfinding, damage estimates and combat-value
projections. Those projections are not fheroes2's `GetStrength` or
`evaluateThreatForUnit`; identical behavior to upstream is not claimed.

Implemented engine actions: ranged attack, reachable melee attack, movement,
defence, catapult shots, first aid and ending the tactics phase. One unit
command is submitted for each active-stack event. Command validity and all
state changes remain the responsibility of the ordinary VCMI game handler.

Not implemented: upstream hero-spell selection, creature-spell selection,
retreat/surrender, archer kiting, exact siege positioning, upstream battle
valuation, adventure-map planning, and support validation for arbitrary mods.
Do not use this partial policy as a quality replacement for the default AI.
No source-policy equivalence evidence has been produced.

## Native battle regressions

`AIIntegrationNativeBattle` creates actual VCMI battles, obtains the active
stack from the engine, requests an action through the factory-created policy,
and sends that action to `BattleProcessor::makePlayerBattleAction`. The test
never chooses an action or forces a winner. Each battle must reach an actual
`BattleResult`, cause damage and stay below 512 stack activations.

The in-process harness is not the graphical client or a full adventure-map
match. Passing it proves that the partial policy can execute these battles,
not that it reproduces the complete upstream algorithm.

The reserved complete-port names must still fail explicitly. In particular,
`FHeroes2` must not silently create `FHeroes2Tactics`.
